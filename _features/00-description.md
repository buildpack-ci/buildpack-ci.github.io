Have you enjoyed the convenience that [buildpacks](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks) give you, especially on the [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) platform, and wished you can have the same convenience in your CI/CD pipeline?  You are probably not alone!

Buildpack CI Run-Tests is a [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) that uses [Herokuish](https://github.com/gliderlabs/herokuish) to give us this convenience on the GitHub platform.  In the simplest case, adding one line to your GitHub Actions [workflow](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow) will build and run unit tests for your app.
